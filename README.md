### Notes to self:
## Docs
     - Pretty much best doc link is for "direct calls to api" - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#uploading_with_a_direct_call_to_the_api
     - List of sections - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_references
     - Incoming transformations on upload - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#incoming_transformations
### TODOS
## Backlog / Should implement
 - Tag items uploaded through this tool to make easier to find online
     - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#tags_method
## Icebox / optional:
 - When uploading images, use filename to check if already uploaded, and if so, offer option to "rename" version on cloudinary sever
     - Use https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#rename_method
