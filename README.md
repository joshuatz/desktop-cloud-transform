# Notes to self:
## Stats logging
### Syntax:
```
Stats::getInstance()->logStat(QString category, QString action,bool usedCloudinary);
```
Example:
```
Stats::getInstance()->logStat("application","startup",false);
```
### Storage
 - Stats are stored with id as primary key (auto-increment) and column with timestamp, as sec since epoch (auto generated by Stats class)
### Established combos
Row | Category | Action | Uses Cloudinary (credits)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | application | upload | false
2 | cloudinary | upload | true
3 | cloudinary | transform | true
4 | cloudinary | store | true
5 | application | download | false
6 | cloudinary | download | true
### Considering Cloudinary Quotas
 - A single action (uploading an image) can trigger many events, some of which can count against a quota. For example
     - Uploading an image, and store original = true, and downloading the final transformed image
         - This would use rows 1 & 5
         - This would also use credit rows 2, 3, 4, & 6
         - Currently, the way I'm doing this it only uses credit row 4 (storing an asset) once, since it stores the original, and then to get the transformed version, it simply fetches the original public URL + transformation string. The transformed version is not actually stored on Cloudinary - it is just a derived asset.

 - Pretty much best doc link is for "direct calls to api" - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#uploading_with_a_direct_call_to_the_api

# TODOS
## !! - High priority - !!
 - Looks like QT is filelocking the image when I display it in the success modal - maybe I can clone it to a temp directory or into memory?
     - Not sure there is going to be an easy solution to this. I think this coming from using QImage (Image{} QML) natively.
         - Idea A) Copy downloaded file to temp dir (same as install or use some QT-get-sysdir type call). Delete after success modal closed, or on timer loop (or on app close or open)
         - Idea B) See if can use JS-in-QML to do something like copy image to canvas, or some other element that might force it into memory vs accessing off disk
         - Idea C) When downloading for user, read into memory as native QPixMap or something like that. Then send to QML layer as a pseudo image (not a resource URL)
 - Cleanup QNetworkReply instances - use deleteLater to free up (probs in slot?)
 - Timeout for auto-close of success modal needs to be auto-cancelled if clicked on
     - For right now, just removed auto-close entirely
 - DB migrations (for install or upgrade)
## Backlog / Should implement
 - Refactor naming of classes, objects, methods - distinction between transformations and configs
 - Tag items uploaded through this tool to make easier to find online
     - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#tags_method
 - Internal stats collection and display to user
     - Optional: API quota warning configured through globalSettings
 - Unit tests
 - Cmd line support
 - Use richtext in textarea for link - https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext-html-subset.html
## Icebox / optional:
 - When uploading images, use filename to check if already uploaded, and if so, offer option to "rename" version on cloudinary sever
     - Use https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#rename_method
 - Move some reusable JS logic stuff out of QML files and into reusable JS files
